After nearly a decade running a successful award-winning business, I’ve transitioned into the world of data and technology. I’m currently training as a **Data Engineer** with [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com), where I’ve been building robust data pipelines, working with cloud technologies, and applying Python, SQL, and ETL practices to real-world projects.

My background in aviation data and business leadership means I value accuracy, efficiency, and clear communication—qualities I now bring into my work as a aspiring Data Engineer.
